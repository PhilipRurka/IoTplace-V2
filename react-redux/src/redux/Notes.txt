To start off connecting Redux with React we’re going to use Provider. Provider is an high order component coming from react-redux.

CONNECT CONNECT CONNECT
What does react-redux’s connect do? Unsurprisingly it connects a React component with the Redux store.

mapStateToProps mapStateToProps mapStateToProps
It connects a part of the Redux state to the props of a React component. By doing so a connected React component will have access to the exact part of the store it needs.

mapDispatchToProps mapDispatchToProps mapDispatchToProps
It connects Redux actions to React props. This way a connected React component will be able to dispatch actions.

~ <Provider store={store}> ... </Provider> ~ This gets the store and passes it into a props.
